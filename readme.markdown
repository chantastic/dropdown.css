# WIP

This is a work in progress. I'll take the big WIP off when it's worth using.
Until then, feel free to make suggestions.

## About

This is a basic css dropdown. My goal is to use the aria API effectively, such
that using the default styles gets you good aria for free.

## Usage

### Copy/paste CSS file

The easiest way is to simply copy this file into your project:
[./css/dropdown.css](https://github.com/chantastic/dropdown.css/blob/master/dst/dropdown.css)

### Node

If you're using a node-based build system, you can `npm i dropdown.css` in your
project and link to it locally `./node_models/dropdown.css/css.dropdown.css`.

## Features

You can see the working sample here:

See a working example in
[./examples/index.html](https://github.com/chantastic/dropdown.css/blob/master/examples/index.html).

This depends on some custom JavaScript. I'm [doing
this](https://github.com/chantastic/dropdown.css/blob/master/examples/js/dropdown.js)
for the sake of demo.
